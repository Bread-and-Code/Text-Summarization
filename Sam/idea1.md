This is a library for implementing **Reinforcment learning with deep learning for text summarization** , which has been converted to a jupyter notebook format to run seamlesly within google colab
here apply some experiments from published papers using this library . 

## Scheduled Sampling with intradecoder 
 

[Bengio et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099). proposed the idea of scheduled sampling for avoiding exposure bias problem.

## Policy-Gradient 
 

[Paulus et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04304). proposed a self-critic policy-gradient model for abstractive text summarization. The following figure represents how this method works and how we implemented this method:
